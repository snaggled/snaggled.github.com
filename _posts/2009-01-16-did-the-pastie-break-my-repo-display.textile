For some weird reason the repo display wasn't showing in the "last post":http://snaggled.github.com/2008/12/29/using-the-github-api-to-display-your-repos.html. The only thing different about it was the pastie, e.g.

<pre>
<script src='http://pastie.org/349089.js'></script>
</pre>

If I make this the last line of text before its piped thru "jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, the repo-display Javascript fails. Wierdness.
