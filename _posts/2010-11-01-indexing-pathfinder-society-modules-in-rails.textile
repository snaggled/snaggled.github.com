I play a lot of "Pathfinder":http://paizo.com, which is actually an incarnation of "Dungeons & Dragons":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons. I love paizo and think the quality of the stuff they produce is outstanding. Anyway, I was having a little trouble navigating the list of modules/scenarios available, so a spare saturday afternoon knocked up a site called "libris arcanis":http://librisarcanis.com. 

This is perfect for Rails. Its a quick "rake task":http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/Task.html to fetch the data, with "active record":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html abstracting all the heavy lifting. All we need to do is stick a controller in front of it and some pretty CSS (which a grabbed from "LFR Compendium":http://www.gamerclubhouse.com/ so kudos to those guys for letting me use it).

I haven't had a chance to add things to github yet, but in short, this is why I love rails. All in, this was about 4-8 hours effort an a saturday afternoon, fueled by:

C'est tout! Getting sprinklers blown out for the winter, must run!
