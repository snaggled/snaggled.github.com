Bringing the blog up was pretty painless, and full kudos must go to "mojombo":http://mojombo.github.com for both the sweet "jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll idea and tool, and even css style (yes, I was that lazy). I love the ability to blog via a git commit, very cool and minimal overhead. The "Textile":http://hobix.com/textile/ format is pretty new to me (I know - where have I been ?) but I'm really enjoying it.

With regard to the whole "git":http://git.or.cz/ vs "svn":http://subversion.tigris.org/ thing, I didn't really have any problems with svn, although the merging process could be a little annoying. I've been using "these guys":http://svnrepository.com/ for a while without complaint, so I'd recommend them if you are taking the svn path. If the git and "github":http://github.com thing works out I may end end moving away from those guys. So far I like the distributed repo aspect of git - the fact I can commit to a local repo and its almost instant, and then push to a remote when I am ready, is great.

I've been planning some big changes to "geosack.com":http://geosack.com (very interested in location based services at the minute), so it may be the first victim to be migrated to "github":http://github.com. Last remaining item on the list is to find & install a git bundle for "Textmate":http://macromates.com/.
