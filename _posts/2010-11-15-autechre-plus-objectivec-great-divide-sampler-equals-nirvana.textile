Honestly, it was. It was like the early 90s all over again - I might as well have had "Poland":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlfd6kG0Lm8 by "Tangerine Dream":http://www.tangerinedream.org/ on the stereo and been hacking away at some Amiga 68k assembler, whilst connecting to a "Razor 1911":http://www.razor1911.com/demo/?menu=history BBS on my trusty "14.4k US Robotics HST modem":http://www.techfuels.com/attachments/general-networking/9618d1230698911-u-s-robotics-usr3453c-u.s.-robotics-usr3453c.jpg (which cost me a fortune back then). I have to say I miss those days. Nonetheless, I managed to get pretty close to that feeling on Saturday night with some iPhone coding, a few of these bad boys:

<br/>                                                                                                        
And this on the stereo:

<br/>
No sine-waves or fun demo comps this time, instead it was some daft Objective-C issue that took me to endorphin-land. All I wanted was to be able to check/uncheck a 'Same As Billing' field in a registration form, and have the form modified accordingly. Hardly rocket-science, right ? Think AJAX inserting some additional fields into an HTML div. I basically wanted the same thing on the iPhone.

In short, we just want things to look like this when the checkbox is marked:    
<br/>
<br/><img class="centered" src="/images/before.png" alt="before"/>        
<br/>

And this when its not:    
<br/>
<br/><img class="centered" src="/images/after.png" alt="after"/>        
<br/>        

Pretty standard "UITableView":http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UITableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html stuff, we need to:

1. Add ourselves as a UITableView "delegate":http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/UITableViewDelegate

<pre class='brush:cpp,gutter:false'> 
@interface RegisterViewController : UIViewController <UITableViewDelegate>,
</pre>
                                                                               
2. Implement didSelectRowAtIndexPath 

<pre class='brush:cpp,gutter:false'> 
- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)view didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)newIndexPath
</pre>

3. Insert & Delete the required sections/rows accordingly

<pre class='brush:cpp,gutter:false'> 
[view insertSections:[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:5] 
  withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
</pre>    
  
Everything worked just peachy, except when I'd try to 're-check' what I'd just unchecked. At that point, it would appear that only a subset of the rows I wanted inserted, would actually appear. In fact, just the last one:

<br/>
<br/><img class="centered" src="/images/final.png" alt="final"/>        
<br/>

I spent several hours banging my head against the desk (i.e. drinking more beer), to eventually figure out that it was "becomeFirstResponder":http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIResponder. I was inadvertently setting each field I created to be the first responder, and it appeared to be working fine, except when I tried to dynamically insert sections/rows and it got very confused.

Some additional care taken when setting becomeFirstResponder, and its all good, got a nice buzz going and it was time to watch "this documentary":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289806/.

<br/>                                                                                                           

Which was epic :)
