Summer is here and its epic. Quit the enterprisey "IBM":http://ibm.com product management job to go back to startup-land. "These guys":http://snugghome.com are very smart, great to work with, and trying to change the world. I've also been knocking out some iPad & Android code at the weekend, so posts to come.

I picked up a used Samsung Captivate so I could get my hands dirty with some "Android OS":http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/package-summary.html code.

The only snag is that it wanted a standard SIM and all I had to hand (from my iPhone 4)was  a micro-sim:

<br/>

A quandary! Not to be outdone, and in the interests of the "hands on imperative":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic#Hands-on_imperative I decided to butcher an old SIM-card and turn it into a placeholder for the micro-SIM. In short:

<br/>

And it works! This pleases me immensely. Android code to come!
